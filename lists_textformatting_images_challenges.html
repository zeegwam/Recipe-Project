            <h2><em>Directions</em></h2>
        <li><strong>For the pesto:</strong> Combine all pesto ingredients exept for the olive oil in a food blender. Blend until<br> mixed and smooth. With the motor running, add olive oil in a slow stream until combined. Pesto should not be too soupy or fine.
        </li>
        <li><strong>For the pesto chicken:</strong> Preheat oven to 450'F.</li>
        <li>Bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil. Add a dash of olive oil and a pinch of salt and cook pasta until al dente. Once the pasta is done, strain well and set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large cast iron skillet over a medium-high heat. Slice the chicken into bite sized strips, season liberally with salt and pepper and cook through.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat down to low and add the strained pasta. Stir in one cup of pesto and toss until fully coated. Top with fresh parmesan and bake for 5 minutes or until cheese has fully melted. Serve immediately.</li>
